# Artificial Heart Design Project

## Overview
This project explores the conceptual design of a mechanical artificial heart
through physiology-based modeling and system-level engineering analysis.
The goal is to identify key constraints, tradeoffs, and safety considerations
early in the design process, with an emphasis on low-cost and accessible solutions.

## Mini Project 1: Cardiac Output Requirements Modeling
**Objective:**  
Determine the blood flow requirements an artificial heart must meet under
different physiological conditions (rest and activity).

**Key Idea:**  
Cardiac output is determined by heart rate and stroke volume and sets the
minimum performance requirements for an artificial heart.

**Design Implication:**  
The pump must support peak cardiac output without inducing excessive shear
stress or hemolysis.

## Mini Project 2: Pump Type Tradeoff Analysis *(In Progress)*
Comparison of pulsatile and continuous-flow pump designs based on:
- Flow stability
- Blood damage risk
- Mechanical complexity
- Energy efficiency

## Why This Matters
Artificial heart design requires balancing physiology, mechanics, and patient safety.
Early modeling helps reduce risk before physical prototyping and guides informed
design decisions.

# About Me

I am a Biomedical Engineering student with a strong interest in artificial organs,
cardiovascular devices, and medical technologies designed for equitable access.

This portfolio documents my independent work in artificial heart design, focusing
on physiology-driven modeling, engineering tradeoffs, and early-stage system analysis.
My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of safe, accessible artificial
organ technologies.

This site reflects both my technical growth and my evolving understanding of
biomedical engineering design.
